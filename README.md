# Obsidian Vale Redux

A plugin that integrates the [Vale](https://vale.sh/) prose linter with Obsidian, providing configurable, offline-first inline style and grammar checking directly in your editor.

## :sparkles: Features
### :tada: Fresh & Shiny Redux Exclusives
- **Configuration management** - Manage your `.vale.ini` from Obsidian
  >[!note]
  	> The Obsidian settings UI is an interface for the file. The plugin does not store any configuration settings, it only reads them from the file. 
- **Issues panel** - View issues in your document from a side panel with click to navigate functionality

### :dizzy: Other Great Features
- **Inline issue display** - Renders issues as decorations in the editor with extra information available on hover
- **Take actions on actions** - Rules with defined fixes can be applied from the hover modal
- **Real-time checking** - Checks the text as you type (configurable)

### :crystal_ball: Planned Features 
- Style settings compatability 
- Advanced issue caching to improve performance 
- Additional UI elements 
- Filter, sort, and search features for the Issues Panel 
- Custom file exclusions
